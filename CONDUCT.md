# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Introduction

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors of this MDS project pledge to making participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body, size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. All participants in this project are expected to show respect and courtesy to others.

Contributors of this project are responsible for enforcing the Code of Conduct. They can be contacted by emailing roc_zhang@hotmail.com or aakanksha023@gmail.com or slbsolomon@gmail.com or SIRINE@gmail.com. All reports will be kept confidential.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the team, finishing distributed work with effort and on-time.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
 advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
 address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
 professional setting

These standards apply to all spaces involved during DSCI 522 including, but not limited to, class and lab meetings, email communication, and online forums such as Slack and GitHub. The DSCI 522 teaching team will also assist with the enforcement of the Code of Conduct.

## Our Responsibilities

Project contributors are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Contributors of this project have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at roc_zhang@hotmail.com or aakanksha023@gmail.com or slbsolomon@gmail.com  or SIRINE@gmail.com. 

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership or the teaching team of DSCI 524.
